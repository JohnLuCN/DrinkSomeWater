Thanks to urkec from https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/microsoft.public.scripting.vbscript/lUubrNektpw. From his comment I found the way to kill the specific task under same parent process name according to ProcessID.

To build this script is to help the people who got lithiasis problem, and help prevent people from similar kind of disease.

Learnt from Researches that, we need 8 cups of water everyday, so I wrote the script to notify us drink water every one hour. And it is all written by VBS and BATCH, any customization can be done, Hope you guys enjoy it ~~ O(∩_∩)O ~~

Currently I am thinking to make a similar function on Android and IOS, but need to learn the relevant programming language, hope it could be published in short term, and can help more people:)

Any ideas, please feel free to contact me.
